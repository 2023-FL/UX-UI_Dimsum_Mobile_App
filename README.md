# UX / UI Mobile App for Dimsum
This user interface design based on the practical operation to apply Adobe XD to create an ordering dimsum interface; in which it contains of the pages of user SignUp, Login, Main Menu, Fire Dimsum, Steam Dimsum, ePayment, AliPay or PayMe, etc.
My UX design focused on designing a seamless and meaningful user experience in a remote ordering processes, which bases on dimsum order  without manual ordering; then the designing intuitive user interfaces relays on the UX design. while UI design focuses on the visual, interactive elements of a product to create aesthetically-pleasing interfaces.
