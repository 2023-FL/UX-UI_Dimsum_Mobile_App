# UX / UI Mobile App for Dimsum
This user interface design based on the practical operation to apply Adobe XD to create an ordering dimsum interface; in which it contains of the pages of user SignUp, Login, Main Menu, Fire Dimsum, Steam Dimsum, ePayment, AliPay or PayMe, etc.
My UX design focused on designing a seamless and meaningful user experience in a remote ordering processes, which bases on common sense of dimsum order without manually payment by walk-in person; the design of user interfaces bases on the principle of an intuitive human-machine interaction and relays on the mechanism of UX design. This UI design created a pretty visual advertisement, aesthetically-pleasing interfaces for selling new concept of e-order for take away of dimsum.
